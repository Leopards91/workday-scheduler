# workday-scheduler

#This workday scheduler is for a typical workday with a 9-5 schedule. In another words, the scheduler starts at 9:00 AM and ends at 5:00 PM. 

When the planner is opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. Then the time blocks for standard business hours (9-5) for each hour
The past is shaded grey, the present hour is shaded as red, and future hours is shaded as green. Clicking on the time block will allow users to type in an event and save by clicking on the time block. Clicking on the save button for that time block will allow the event to be saved locally so refreshing the page, the event is still saved. Clicking on the trash can will delete the event.
